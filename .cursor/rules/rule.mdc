Build a modern, minimalistic business dashboard in plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, using data loaded dynamically from ./RECAP PENAWARAN 025.csv. The UI must be clean, quiet, and professional with consistent spacing, soft neutral colors, and one accent color. All dashboard widgets (KPI cards, charts, tables) must be modular: each box is removable, collapsible, and moveable via drag-and-drop, with smooth transitions. Provide default KPI and chart views that highlight the most important quarterly insights, but allow toggling and adjusting data ranges or filters to explore deeper. Keep the design unobtrusive with careful use of whitespace, subtle gridlines, minimal text, small icons, and legible modern typography. The charts must follow strong data-visualization discipline: only highlight what matters, avoid unnecessary colors and decorations, and animate gently. Use Chart.js or D3 (either is allowed in pure HTML/CSS/JS) with clean modular code and reusable rendering functions. Everything must feel dynamic, lightweight, and executive-class: a dashboard suitable for a Q3 board meeting, showing insight—not noise.
